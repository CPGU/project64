# Project 64 - Intro to Programming Final Pair Coursework


## Introduction
Our application is built to visually represent data collected by the government within the housing market dating between 1995 and 2015.

## Aims
- Our aim is to display multiple types of graphs and charts to enable easy data analysis.
- We will provide information for sales volumes, average sales prices and potentially a few more areas.
- UX - make it user friendly and enable customisable data searches.
- mobile friendly

## What we've done so far
- Gathered multiple csv files for use in this application.
- So far we have managed to extract data from a csv file, and have displayed the data for each specific region onto a full window graph.
- We have worked on obtaining specific data from the csv files, for example extracting the sum of all sales volumes per year, by region.
- We have created a basic user interface with a dropdown menu of all available regions.

## A few problems we may face...
- Responsiveness with mobile friendly. Especially with graph resizing.
- Switching between data vis modes. ie. switching between monthly and yearly views.
